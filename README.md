# Webdev
My web development journey
I have started to learn web development for future personal projects and to contribute to open source organizations. I already have a fair knowledge and experience of using html and css and currently learning javascript through w3schools. My initial focus is react so that my frontend development skills can be honed. After that i will moving towards the server end part so as to have a full stack web development skill.
